            <p class="top-flat">
                As a primary focus, our target audience has a need to know the weather. There will always be
                something in the works, and our visitors will need to know what to anticipate throughout the
                week. The target might not be fully computer literate, but the site functionality should be
                simple and clean to provide a pleasant user experience. Our target will most likely reside
                in or near Preston, Soda Springs, and Fish Haven. They’ll have an interest in local events
                and news reports.

                <p class="scenerios">
                    Max is often looking for an adventure. If it's going to snow, he'll be ready! If the sun is shining, he's making plans
                    to cook up a feast! He needs to know what the weather is going to be like in the next few days. This site will provide that information.
                </p>
                <p class="scenerios">
                    Shirayuki is planting a garden this year. Rabbits need to eat, but their food can't handle a hard frost.
                    She'll be relying on local reports to find out when it's safe to plant a garden. With our website providing
                    local news, the information will surely be available.
                </p>
                <p class="scenerios">
                    Is it going to rain today? If so, Max needs to know. He'd hate to have his lawn burn up when his
                    boy can be watering it down with the hose. By providing information about the current weather, our site
                    can help Max deligate his responsibilities.
                </p>
                <p class="scenerios">
                    Volunteer work is hard work! Shirayuki can always find people in need of her assistance with the local news
                    postings. The soup kitchen is often mentioned when help is needed most. With a website focused on three
                    specific locations, there should be ample opportunities to serve the community.
                </p>
                <p class="scenerios">
                    Is that snow rolling in? Max runs a side business with a plow. There's fierce competition out there and our
                    forecast will give ample warning to be prepared.
                </p>
                <p class="scenerios">
                    Illustrators are always in need of inspiration. The gallery within our pages will provide fresh new
                    images of the majestic scenery for Shirayuki to peruse.
